 * to change one of the constants (assuming you keep your object files around)
 * is change the constant in this file and type 'make'.  Make will recompile
 * this file and relink; you don't have to wait for the whole thing to
 * recompile as you do if you change a header file.
 *
 * I realize that it would be slightly more efficient to have lots of
 * #defines strewn about, so that, for example, the autowiz code isn't
 * compiled at all if you don't want to use autowiz.  However, the actual
 * code for the various options is quite small, as is the computational time
 * in checking the option you've selected at run-time, so I've decided the
 * convenience of having all your options in this one file outweighs the
 * efficency of doing it the other way.
